# BurgerTime


Burger Time is an arcade game where the player is chef Peter Pepper, who must walk over hamburger ingredients located across a maze of platforms while avoiding pursuing characters.

The object of the game is to complete a number of hamburgers while avoiding enemy foods. Each board consists of a maze of planks and ladders in which giant burger ingredients (buns, patties, lettuce/tomato, etc.) are laid out.

This project is a partial implementation of the original game using a self-written game engine in c++. The engine is bootstrapped from a minimal engine 'Minigin' provided by DAE.
